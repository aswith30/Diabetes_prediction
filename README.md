# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements using various machine learning algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which includes the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

> The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **XX%**. *(Replace with your actual result)*

## ⚙️ Technologies and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter (for `.ipynb` notebooks)
- VS Code (as the development environment)

## 🗂️ Project Structure

## 🚀 How to Run (Locally in VS Code)

1. **Open VS Code** and load the project folder.

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
## Install the requirements.txt
## Also Model.py is available


## 💡 Future Improvements
Build a web app using Streamlit or Flask for real-time predictions.

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Add more datasets or combine with real-world medical records for improved accuracy.
